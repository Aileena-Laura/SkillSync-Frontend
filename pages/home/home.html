  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>
      SkillSync is designed to make collaboration between students and companies seamless. Companies can create profiles and post projects where they need help, specifying the skills, education, and location preferences they’re seeking. Once a project is posted, SkillSync’s platform matches students based on their profiles, which include their skills, field of study, and location. 
  </p>
  <p>
      As a student, you can browse these projects and find the ones that best match your expertise and career interests. The platform ensures that you are matched with relevant projects, allowing you to gain real-world experience while studying. It’s a win-win for both parties: companies benefit from student input on projects, while students gain valuable hands-on experience, enhance their resumes, and expand their professional networks.
